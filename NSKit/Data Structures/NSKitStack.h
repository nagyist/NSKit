/** A stack is a linear list in which insertions (also called additions) and deletions take place at the same end. This end is called the top. The other end is called the bottom. 
 
 - Stack is a specialized or restricted version of a more general data object linear list.
 - Every instance of the data object stack is also an instance of the data object linear list. Moreover, all stack operations can be performed as linear list operations.
 - This specialized version of the stack is created by extending the NSMutableArray.
